The game just won't stop getting hacked by random kids, so I've decided to make CC private again, possibly forever. At the very start of CC, it was just private for me and my friends. It was more fun for me that way, because no drama, no kids to ban, and no hackers. I'd like to say thanks to this community for giving me an amazing experience running this game. And to my 60 friends/staff members, see you when the private version comes out.

Goodbye, HarryDog
