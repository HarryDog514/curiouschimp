Message of the day: Happy Halloween Monkes! I hope you enjoy it. Cosmetics are in! At the info monke stand, it has been replaced with a cosmetics store! 
These cosmetics are seasonal only, but we will have some normal cosmetics soon! Now, an announcement I would like to make. I have seen Trout's video. 
If you haven't, it basically is trying to make people aware of the many "fangames" which have little to no effort put into them. I would like to state 
that this is not one of those fangames. In this update I've added swimming, cosmetics and the next update will be names. I've also moved this closer to 
you because the double walls are fricking annoying. This is a big update!
