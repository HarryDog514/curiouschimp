Well, it's that time of year again folks. Everyone is happy and smiling, looking
foward to what the next year has to offer. People are pranking pizza delivery
companies saying "You're a year late" and sleep depriving themselves to stay
up and shoot fireworks and watch the new year countdown live on TV or Youtube.
Happy New Year! We've fixed a couple bugs and added a new shop! Go and check
out the new cosmetics before 3 of them are gone.
