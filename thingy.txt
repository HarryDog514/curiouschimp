Hey Chimps, if you guys are wondering why you can't connect to any servers, or if you're staff, you don't have any of your stuff, that's because unfortunately the game got hacked again. The good news is I have a backup of PlayFab (inventory system that got hacked) and I'm just going to wait until I'm sure the hackers have given up until I restart servers. Sorry about all this.
