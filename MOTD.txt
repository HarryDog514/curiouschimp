Late fall has finally come (sorry for delaying it so long lol) and Happy Thanksgiving to those of you who celebrate it. If you don't, well, enjoy your late fall and this update.
New things:

- do not look at the top of the map.
- Lake has iced over
- Horror Level 3
- Rain has cleared up
- No new cosmetics, but the winter stuff is in progress
